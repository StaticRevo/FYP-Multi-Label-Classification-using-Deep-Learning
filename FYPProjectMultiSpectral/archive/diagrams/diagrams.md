# Diagram Collection

This folder contains all the diagrams used throughout the Final Year Project documentation and presentation.

## Authorship and Tools

All diagrams included in this directory were **individually created by me** as part of the design, analysis, and presentation of the project. No external diagram sources were used.

### Tools Used:
- **Draw.io**: For system architecture, workflow diagrams, and model design.
- **Edraw Max**: For high-quality conceptual and UML diagrams.
- **Python Scripts**: Custom Python code (e.g., Matplotlib, Graphviz, and other visualization libraries) was used to generate certain model summaries and evaluation charts.
