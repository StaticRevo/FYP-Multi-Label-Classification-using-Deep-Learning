### Description
The Eurostat Sentinel-2 dataset is a large collection of satellite images that were captured by the Sentinel-2 satellite, which is part of the European Space Agency's Compernicus Program. This dataset was created to facilitate reseach in remote sensing and computer vision especially in the context of land use classification as done in my project. The Sentinel-2 dataset was also created for training machine learning models. The dataset contains** ** 27,000 ** labeled and geo-refenced images** accross **10 different classes** which cover **13 spectral bands** including Visible (RGB), Infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands among many others. One of the major strengths of such dataset is that the images presented have a spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel making the images high in resolution and assisting in providing specific and detailed information on Earth's surface.
