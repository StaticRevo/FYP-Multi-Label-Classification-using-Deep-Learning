# Deep Learning-Based Land Use Classification Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
## Dataset: Eurostat Sentinel-2
For my project, I made use of the EuroSAT Sentinel-2 land use dataset. This dataset consists of thousand of high-resolution imagess captured during by the Sentinel-2 mission. The images contain images captured at different spectral bands ranging from visible to infrared wavelengths with different resolutions and colours. In total each image contains **13 colour bands**, which is used to help identify the different land cover types in the case of our project. More information is given in the report of the project.
