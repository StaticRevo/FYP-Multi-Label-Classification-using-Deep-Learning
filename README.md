## Overview
This project is my Final Year Project for the course of Software Development. It aims to classify land cover types from satellite imagery using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By making use of deep learning techniques, the goal is to accurately **identify and categorise** the various types of land cover such as forests, urban areas and pasture. This classification supports various application such as evnvironmental monitoring, urban plannning and distaster management.

Satellite imagery can help us find solutions to the growing number of environmental problems that humans face today. It allows us to not only get a bird’s eye view of what’s around us, but also uncovers parts of the world that are rarely seen. Tapping into the potential of categorizing land cover and land use around the world means that humans can more efficiently make use of natural resources, hopefully lowering cases of waste and deprivation. However, despite its potential to be incredibly useful, satellite data is massive and complex, requiring sophisticated analysis to make sense of it.

This project aims to address this issue by developing a CNN model capable of classifying land cover types in satellite imagery. This capability can benefit a variety of stakeholders, including conservationists, urban planners, and environmental scientists, by helping them survey and identify patterns in land use. This allows for the detection of natural areas under threat or the identification of regions suitable for urban development.

## Project Goals
The primary objective of is project is to develop a **robust and accurate** model for classifyig land cover types from satellite imagery. To achieve this the project has been structred around a number of key goals that guide the development process and ensure the model’s practical applicability in various fields. These goals are designed to address the complex challenges associated with satellite imagery analysis and to maximize the utility of the classification model for different stakeholders, such as environmental scientists, urban planners, and agricultural companies. Below, we outline the specific goals that this project aims to accomplish:

1. **Creating a Robust CNN Model** that is capable of accurately classifying land cover types from then dataset provided.
2. **Achieving high classification accuracy** across different land cover types.
3. **Visualising Model Performance** to understand the strengths of the model and the areas of imporvement.
4. **Utilising and Adapting Pr-trained Models** to achieve even better results than training a model from scratch.
5. **Providing Comprehensive Documentation** by documenting the entire process from data preprocessing and model training to the eveluation stages.
6. **Developing Usable Tools** by creating scripts and tools to process the satellite images, training the model and also making predictions.
